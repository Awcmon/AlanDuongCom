			<h1>Springy Sanic</h1>
			<p>Back in my junior year of high school, my friends and I thought a badly drawn picture of Sonic the Hedgehog, called Sanic, was hilarious.</p>

			<p>I also thought it would be hilarious if said character was actually in a game.</p>

			<p>A weekend came and went. At the end of it, I had created Springy Sanic because I thought it would be funny. The game looks terrible, but it was supposed to look terrible because I thought it would be funny.</p>

			<p>This game was written in C++ using SDL2.</p>

			<p>Some time later, I decided to learn Unity. In my opinion, there is no better way to learn a game engine than to just make a game with it.</p>

			<p>I ended up remaking Springy Sanic because it was a simple game.</p>

			<p>This new version had a less courageous art direction.</p>
