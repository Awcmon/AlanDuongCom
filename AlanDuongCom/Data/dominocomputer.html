			<h1>Domino Computer</h1>
			<p>One time I watched a Computerphile video where they made a binary half adder out of dominos and I thought that was cool.</p>

			<p>However, I did not have any dominos, want to buy any dominos, have the physical space to set up a ton of dominos, or want to spend a lot of time setting up dominos. So I made a program where I could do that sort of thing without any of the downsides.</p>

			<p>The rules for how the program works are inspired from how dominos work and a working binary half adder is demonstrated inside the video on this page.</p>

			<p>Written in C++ using SDL2.</p>
