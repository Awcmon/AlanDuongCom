			<h1>alanduong.com</h1>
			<p>This site was created with a sort of static site generator I wrote in C#.</p>

			<p>There's a billion static site generators out there but I ended up writing my own because I wanted something simple. I can write this website like I would with plain HTML and CSS, except the especially tedious parts are automated.</p>

			<p>I mostly just prefer the workflow. I can do all my work in Visual Studio then just hit the run button and my site pops out within a second.</p>
